This repositoy is about the containarized interface between CHARMM and GAMESS programs.

Due to licensing demands for both GAMESS and CHARMM, the container
itself is not on this repository. One must first obtain the license
for CHARMM and GAMESS programs, both free of charge and then write to
milan@cmm.ki.si to obtain access to the container itself.

In the future I will provide a protoype container that can compile
CHARMM and GAMESS by the users themselves, but for now I make one
myself and put it on a private link.
