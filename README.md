This test folder is modfied charmm/test/cquantumtest/gmstst.inp file

to perform QM/MM frequency calculations with jupyter notebooks

There are 3 notebooks:

1. [sim](sim.ipynb) performs QM/MM minimization claculation

2. [vib](vib.ipynb) performs QM/MM frequency calculations and stores normal
   modes into freq.amode for further analysis
   
3. [frq](frq.ipynb) generates trajecory files for any chosen normal mode
   corresponding to a selected frequncy
